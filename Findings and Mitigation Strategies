The analysis was driven by five critical concentration risks derived directly from the dashboard visuals:

Finding 1: Critical Credit Quality Concentration
Data Point: 77.78% of the total portfolio value resides in the high-risk Grade D credit tier, with an additional 6.26% in Grade C.
Risk: This signifies an inherently high Probability of Default (PD) for the majority of the book. The bank's financial stability is disproportionately tied to the performance of its lowest-quality assets.

Finding 2: High Geographic & Systematic Risk
Data Point: Loans are heavily concentrated in a few states, with Uttar Pradesh ($9.43M), Rajasthan, and Maharashtra being the primary sources.
Risk: This creates Systematic Risk. A localised economic shock or policy change in one of these states could cause simultaneous, correlated defaults, creating a material loss event.

Finding 3: Significant Single-Name Concentration
Data Point: The top 5 borrowers (e.g., Vivam Mehta, Ananya Chopra) hold a visibly large, disproportionate share of the loan book.
Risk: This is Idiosyncratic Risk. The default of even a single one of these high-value borrowers, regardless of overall economic health, would severely impact the bank's asset quality and earnings.

Finding 4: Undue Reliance on High-Risk Products
Data Point: The single largest loan purpose is Debt Consolidation. The religious distribution is also highly skewed toward one demographic (Christian, 75.89%).
Risk: Debt Consolidation is highly sensitive to consumer income shocks. This lack of product and demographic diversity amplifies sensitivity to market-specific risks.

Finding 5: Collection and Asset Realisation Gap
Data Point: Total Principal ($61.32M) significantly exceeds Total Collection ($26.97M), with $3.89M already marked as Default.
Risk: This indicates potential issues in collection efficiency, a high volume of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), or an inability to realize expected cash flows, leading to Liquidity Risk.



These are the actionable steps I recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve portfolio health:

Mitigation Strategy 1: Portfolio Rebalancing:
Action: Implement a Risk-Adjusted Pricing (RAP) Model to automatically increase the interest rate premium on new Grade D loans.
Impact: This compensates for the high risk and strategically encourages the Sales team to shift origination efforts toward more profitable, less risky (Grade A/B) segments.

Mitigation Strategy 2: Concentration Limit Mandates:
Action: Establish and monitor strict Hard Limits on exposure: capped at 10% of the loan book for any single state and mandatory Large Exposure Thresholds for any single borrower.
Impact: Reduces the bank's vulnerability to single points of failure (geographic or single-client) and forces responsible growth in underserved, lower-risk markets.

Mitigation Strategy 3: Collection Efficiency Audit:
Action: Lead a Level 2 Drilldown to generate the Days Past Due (DPD) ageing schedule for the $61.32M principal.
Impact: This pinpoints which specific segments (e.g., Grade D in Uttar Pradesh) are driving the $3.89M in defaults, allowing for surgical intervention and revision of underwriting criteria.

Strategic Recommendations & Business Impact
The following strategic actions were recommended to the Executive Committee to stabilise the portfolio and enforce smarter lending practices:

Recommendation 1: Dynamic Risk-Based Pricing & Strategy
Action: Mandate the immediate revision of the Risk-Adjusted Pricing (RAP) Model to ensure the premium charged for Grade D loans (77.78% of the book) fully compensates for the assigned default risk.
Business Impact: Improves the risk-adjusted return on capital and incentivises the Sales team to aggressively target higher-grade (A/B) borrowers to diversify and improve overall portfolio quality.

Recommendation 2: Strict Concentration Limits
Action: Establish and enforce Hard Limits to control exposure: 1) Cap single-state exposure (e.g., Uttar Pradesh) at 10% of total assets, and 2) Initiate an urgent Collateral Re-evaluation Audit for the Top 5 Borrowers to ensure the bank's exposure is fully secured.
Business Impact: Provides a structured, quantifiable framework for mitigating systemic and idiosyncratic risks, stabilising the bank's solvency.

Recommendation 3: Targeted Collection Process Overhaul
Action: Initiate a Level 2 Drilldown analysis to segment the $3.89M in defaults by both Credit Grade and Geography.
Business Impact: This root-cause analysis will provide the feedback loop needed to revise underwriting criteria, focusing specifically on the high-risk segments identified (e.g., Grade D loans in the top three states).
